# Tile-Recursion-Demo

This program created a visual representation of the recursive method generating a tile sequence around a missing tile piece using 'L' shaped tiles.
This experiment has a way to make the tiles appear with J-Pane so the user can visually see the tiles formed with color coordination.
-Before running the program be sure to edit the size of the grid under "Edit Configurations" under CLI Arguments the grid is formed with "0 0 0"
 add the base number of tiles to the grid for example a 4x4 grid with the graphical position (0,0) would be "4 0 0"
-Tiles are shown inside the console with '+', '-', '|'. to form and 'L' shaped tile wrapped around a missing tile space '*'.
-You can change the pixel size with "TILE_SIZE".
-You can change the color with " Color.".
 
 Enjoy the cool designs!
